ðŸš€ ISRO Website Redesign (Unofficial - Student Project)

This is an unofficial, student-made redesign of the ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) website, created as part of a learning project.

Key Features:

Space-inspired dark interface, fully responsive across devices

Kinetic typography on the Careers page

Interactive mission cards with detailed modals

Animated job role showcases with an easy-to-use application form

Emphasis on storytelling, accessibility, and engagement
